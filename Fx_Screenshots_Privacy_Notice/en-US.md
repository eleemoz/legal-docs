Things you should know
We care about your privacy. When Mozilla (that's us) collects information about you, our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we handle that information.

Mozilla automatically receives the content of your shots, as well as technical and interaction data about your use of Firefox Screenshots in order to provide functionality and improve performance.

Content: Your shots are sent to Mozillaâ€™s servers.  We may access your shots when reasonably necessary for the operation of the service.  You can delete your Shots at any time.  Shots that are not saved by you will be automatically deleted after 14 days.  

Interaction data: This includes data about how often shots are accessed and shared by you or others; whether people who view shots install Firefox Screenshots; data about visits to the Firefox Screenshots website; and your interactions with buttons, tiles, and mouse movements related to shot capture.  

Technical data: This includes data about the average size and number of your captured shots; your Firefox version; device operating system; and errors.  Your IP address is also collected as a part of a standard server log for security monitoring (e.g. to detect and block individuals who misuse the service.
